# ðŸ“± Responsive Hamburger Sidebar Menu (HTML + CSS)

This is a simple, elegant, **responsive sidebar menu** project made using pure **HTML and CSS** â€” no JavaScript involved. It features a **hamburger icon** that, when clicked, reveals a stylish sidebar menu with navigation links and social media icons. The menu can be closed by clicking the **cross (Ã—) icon**, placed on the same line as the hamburger.

## ðŸš€ How It Works  

- **A hidden checkbox** (`input[type="checkbox"]`) is used to track the sidebar state (open/closed).
- **Two icons** (hamburger and cross) toggle their visibility based on the checkbox state using CSS sibling selectors.
- **The sidebar slides in from the left** when the checkbox is checked.
- **Pure CSS transitions** make the animations smooth.
- No JavaScript is required â€” this is accomplished entirely using CSS techniques like the **checkbox hack** and **positioning**.
